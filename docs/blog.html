                            on 29 April 2021
                        </span>
                        <p>This week was spent exploring both meditation and yoga experiences. We expanded on the groundwork that we set up the previous week as well as resolving several bugs. Also we transfered our development environment from Glitch to local development with VSCode and the Live Server extension. Although this week was a busy and hectic week for everyone, we were still able to make solid progress.</p>
                        <h3>Successes and Accomplishments From This Week</h3>
                        <p>
                            Matthew started researching and developing feedback for meditation mode. Users can use this feature by either lying down or standing and holding or placing the controller on their belly. The current implementation tracks the users controllers as they inhale/exhale and provides visual feedback with a ring that dynamically resizes with each breath. Breath tracking can currently accessed through the meditation menu and pressing the
                            <strong>x-button</strong>
                            once it is selected in the menu. It can also be removed using the same button.
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            <i>Current breath capture feedback mechanism</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hristo and Jane worked on designing and improving the menu interface that we started last week. New additions include additional info text for each option as well as a volume slider. Jane made the menu items usable by integrating the meditation audios/scripts that she recorded and edited as well as the sounds she compiled. So far each meditation option plays a recording when clicked, but the yoga options are still currently placeholders. Jane also started implementing sound and music selection to give users finer control of the soundscape. Currently the menu can be activated and deactivated by pressing the
                            <strong>a-button</strong>
                            and options can be selected using the
                            <strong>right trigger.</strong>

                            <i>Menu with options and sliders</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hristo also tried adjusting the lighting of the scene since the colors seemed a bit dull. He also tried adjusting shadows to improve immersion and the overall aesthetic.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Phi worked on developing the yoga experience with recorded scripts as well as a display that leads a yoga session. He used some of his prior yoga experience to create slides with instructions as well as drawings with poses. Currently users do not use their controllers during a yoga session.

                        <p>
                            Matthew also started implementing a home screen for users to select their room but that is still a work in progress. Jane also tried animating the sky, but proved harder than we initially thought it would be. We are currently exploring other methods of adding life to the sky like 3D cloud and star models. Overall, we feel as though we made decent progress this week.

                        <p>We will connect the experiences together and unify them with the menu to have our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in time for the midterm presentation on May 4th. Also taking care of bugs that have surfaced.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>Blocking Issues</h3>
                        <p>| This past week has been been a slightly slower week because we are 'getting into the thick of the quarter' - Phi. But, most things are coming together and mostly depend on connecting | the different elements together into a cohesive project. There are still some small hurdles that we may encounter in doing this, but we currently do not have any apparent blockers.</p>

                            on 22 April 2021
                        </span>
                        <p>This week started off with a successfully completed PRD and continuing the development of our various ideas for the project. The base of the customization of the garden as well as the start of the meditation activity of this app had been set so this week we spent a lot of time cleaning up small bugs and diving deeper into the activities part of our project, where the user will be able to participate in various relaxing activities in their zen garden.</p>
                        <h3>Successes and accomplishments from this week</h3>
                        <p>
                            Matthew was able to figure out how to add the rotation aspect when placing on object on the floor. Instead of the small preview that was there before, when the user wants to place an asset in their garden, they will have an accurate representation of how the asset would look like when placed. This includes the orientation of the object in relation to the zen garden. There were a few bugs with the rotation from the previously small preview of the asset to the rotation of the actual size asset but making the preview of the asset the actual size of the asset itself seemed to work well.
                            <br />

                            <i>Showcasing the rotation functionality when placing down assets.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>Matthew also continues to work on and manage the multiplayer component of this zen garden, continuing to make sure that the different activities such as meditation are working on all views of the players. He has also been working on fixing up bugs from the open source code that we utilized.</p>
                        <p>
                            Jane continued to work on the meditation UI. She designed what "meditation mode" would look like, one of which was to have lanterns around the garden or close by that would light up, giving off a soft glow look which would light up as the sky dimmed, shifting the garden into "meditation mode". She started off by 3d modelling the "meditaion building", which for now is the big structure/room in the middle of the garden. She did not have much luck on having that lantern glow effect, but Hristo was able to 3d model some awesome lanterns and lights that would illuminate when the user enters meditation mode. Hristo also added the functionality of when the user teleports into the meditation room, "meditation mode" would be triggered and untriggered, so the user will enter "meditation mode" by teleporting into the room.

                        </p>
                        <p>Jane is now working on finding more music appropriate for meditation and yoga in the future. She uses preview music from the Adobe stock library, to preview what kind of music would be part of this zen garden simulation. Jane has also been writing meditation scripts and narrating them. She is also working on some audio editing to combine the scripts with music.</p>
                        <p>
                            Hristo, along with working on the "meditation mode", continued to work on the locomotion and teleportation functionality of our project. Last week for our demo, we had different bases where the user can teleport to and move around the garden. But now, the user is able to use the joystick on the right hand controller to navigate anywhere on the ground of the garden.

                        <p>
                            Hristo is now working on the Meditation UI, how the user can choose between different types of meditation scripts, (along with how this UI could also be used with yoga), and also what kind of UI the user will see in order to choose different background music and dimming the surroundings.

                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Phi started to work on the yoga component of our vr application. He set up a really cool layout of having a slideshow and timer that the user can follow along with different poses. He set up instructional slides, as well as slides and graphics that help the user to follow along with the yoga routine. He also added a timer to demonstrate how the user can see when they should go onto the next pose. But Phi also noticed that it may be difficult for the user to try and look at the slides while doing the pose, so maybe next steps in developing this would be to add a voice narration for the user to follow along, as well as the slides.

                            Overall, we feel as though we made lots of great progress this week. As noted before, we are developing our codebase in Glitch and using Github for version control. This is the link to our ongoing project development

                        <h3>Plan for Next Week</h3>
                        <p>We will finish wrapping up the main parts of the meditation portion of our application and also continue to fix minor details. But we will also start working on the aethetics and what the user sees as well.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>Blocking Issues</h3>
                        <p>This past week has been going relatively smoothly. We may run into some blockers when working on user breath tracking, and lighting in aframe has been a tricky ride. Also, we are out of disk space on glitch... so that is problematic. But it seems like we will be able to switch and work from gitlab so we hope that will solve that problem. We still have a good vision and idea of what we should do for our tasks, however, so as of right now we don't forsee any major blocking issues for the upcoming week.</p>

                            on 15 April 2021
                        </span>
                        <p>
                            This was our first week where we started developing many of the ideas we have been sketching out. We also made some great progress on fleshing out our
                            <a href="deliverables.html#prd">product requirement document</a>
                            (PRD). We also completed out
                            <a href="deliverables.html#project-pitch">project pitch.</a>
                            We are excited to review the progress we made this week and get started with our tasks for next week.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What every member did and Project Resources</h3>
                        <p>Collectively, we worked on the project presentation due April 13. We also split up responsibilities related to the PRD, then worked together to nail down the scope of the project and what we wanted to focus on each week. Particularly, after our presentation we realized that the meditation/yoga aspect was a more appealing feature than we previously realized so we tailored our PRD so that our garden customization is still present but simple so we can focus on interesting meditation tools.</p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore, we each started designing particular base components of our simulation that would be needed no matter what stretch goals we decided to focus on. In particular, Phi found some UI components that we could plug into our application and after deciding on a design Matthew ported the UI component from a
                            <a href="https://github.com/kfarr/aframe-city-builder/tree/f7f7c9c9ade67daa0c3d89c4aeb7f9021ad794d8">city builder game</a>
                            to work on the Oculus 2 with our plant assets. Similarly Phi got some basic asset placement and movement working with the UI. A simple way of undoing the last placed asset was added as well.
                            <br />
                            <img src="assets/img/palette.gif" width="500px" />
                            <br />
                            <i>Showcasing initial prototype of the asset placement UI.</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>Since we wanted some simple multiplayer interactions in our garden, Matthew set up Croquet integration with the project. This facilitates unique "rooms" that can be accessed by anyone by typing in a "room id". They can thus enter a room with others and view any modifications to the room and see the other players in the room since assets are mirrored over using Croquet's view/model system.</p>
                        <p>
                            We also needed a simple way to navigate around the garden, so Hristo researched some teleportation based locomotion techniques and integrated a teleportation based system into our project with predefined checkpoints that the user may select to teleport to.
                            <br />
                            <img src="assets/img/teleport-base.gif" width="500px" />
                            <br />
                            <i>Showcasing initial teleport prototype</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jane focused first on getting music working in A-Frame using
                            <a href="">this music management component.</a>
                            Once that was complete, she started developing what the meditation UI should look like and what sort of information we are going to be recording and giving feedback about to the user.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also had some fun with blender to get some basic low-poly plants to interact with in our garden. Hristo, for example, made this nice looking cherry-blossom asset.
                            <img src="assets/img/cherry-blossom.png" />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All in all, good progress was made this week. We are developing our codebase in Glitch and using Github for version control, so you can see our ongoing project development

                        <h3>Plan for Next Week</h3>
                        <p>Next week we plan on finishing up some of the bugs that we have yet to resolve in the UI and start working on the meditation aspect of the project. In particular, we have assigned ourselves the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Hristo and Jane:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Finish basic locomotion</li>
                                    <li>A more elegant asset shall be used to mark a teleportation site</li>
                                    <li>
                                        Start work on meditation-specific UI, add in music selection and integrate locomotion into the UI
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>User may select from a number of soundtracks</li>
                                            <li>The user can select from a menu which meditation technique to use, what music should play, if they would like to teleport, and music volume</li>
                                            <li>The UI component shall be the same as that used in asset placement</li>
                                            <li>Write script for initial meditation tutorial</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>
                                Phi and Matthew:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Finish asset placement UI.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The y component of the left joystick shall allow the user to rotate the sample object in the user’s hand and when placed the object shall reflect this angle.</li>
                                            <li>The bug in the asset placement UI that causes the right arrow to intermittently disappear shall be resolved</li>
                                            <li>Add option for up/down arrows to menu UI to be used in meditation UI</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Investigate meditation feedback mechanisms that may be used to monitor the user
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Use phone to monitor heart rate</li>
                                            <li>Test oculus quest speaker system, see if microphone can capture breathing</li>
                                            <li>Explore possibility of webcam capture for capturing body positions</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Blocking Issues</h3>
                        <p>We believe we have a good grasp of what our initial product should look like, the only thing left now is to continue to implement it! Right now there are a lot of tasks to do, all of which are currently going smoothly so we don't forsee any major blocking issues the next week.</p>

                        <p>In our first week, we got ourselves oriented with the tools we would be using through the WebXR tutorial and discovered possible interesting technologies we could use for our project in Glitch and Croquet through the class tutorials. We created a team discord and set about coming up with an idea for our project.</p>
                        <p>We bounced around several before coming up with the idea of a virtual zen garden - with Zendin as our working title! The idea of having a customizable, relaxing open space in the virtual world was something that we all liked the idea of and we came up with plenty of possible extensions from this - meditation, gardening, yoga, and more! Virtual spaces can offer a new social outlet in an interesting medium, and the pandemic has shown how sometimes we all need to get away to our own space, which our virtual zen garden is an option we’re hoping to provide.</p>

                        <p>We feel like we’ve made some great progress together already and we’re excited to get started creating the basics of our virtual world together! For next week, we’ve scheduled some meetings already to hash out the details of our product pitch presentation and our project requirements document, so we have a solid base to build on while developing.</p>
